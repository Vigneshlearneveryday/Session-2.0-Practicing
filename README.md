# Restarting My Practice

Life is a journey of many beginnings. This repository is not just a collection of code it is the story of a restart, a new chapter where I rebuild, relearn, and rediscover myself.

## What This Repository Represents
It is a reminder that no matter how many times life challenges us, we can always choose to stand up, take a breath, and start again. Here, you’ll find projects and practices that reflect my determination to grow and create.

## Technologies I Work With
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  

## Why This Matters
In every piece of code, there is a reflection of thought, effort, and learning. This repository symbolizes not just technical growth but also the power of resilience and an interest for building things that matter.
